From Jong Kim (6/29/2021)
idea is to increase max iteration numbers and tolerance on thermo solution steps

./icepack/columnphysics/icepack_therm_shared.F90
ferrmax = 1.0e-3_dbl_kind
we can try ferrmax = 1.0e-2_dbl_kind
If you use your own model build

./icepack/columnphysics/icepack_therm_bl99.F90
./icepack/columnphysics/icepack_therm_0layer.F90
nitermax = 100 to 200
nitermax = 50 to 100
I think these options will give some idea
more ideal option might be separate runs of ice da and ocean da
as we don't have reallistic balance btw sst and ice

1)Q: The crash is because dvice is negative, but with extremely small negative values.
A: you have to use kitd=0 in ice_in.
it's a bug. cice6 people have to fix this issue. til then, we have to use kitd=0
with kitd=0, we are not redistributing ice thickness in each category

2)When it blows up with themo solver side. We will try to adress the issue with bigger tolerence.

(I am thinking about setting single obs test on iceda to see if we can find evidence with balance issue).

ktherm=1 means BL99; 2 means mushy 
If trying to switch from BL99 to mushy, ktherm and tfrz_option need to be changed.
